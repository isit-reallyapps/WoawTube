# WoawTube
The YouTube Downloader from the WoawApps Collection.

This app is made to be the alternative to those spammy, ad littered Youtube downloaders that are currently available.
This is still early phases in the project where thus far functionality is limited and there is no cross-platform support.

As I continue to lay the foundation for the functionality that is required to turn this into a full production application
I will continue to push updates here.

# USAGE Windows
1. Download the WoawTube.zip file and extract to whichever location you like
2. There'll be 1 file (WoawTube) and 1 folder.
3. You can copy that WoawTube file to where is more convenient for you (it's a shortcut)
4. All your videos will download to the WoawTube Downloads folder

# USAGE Linux
1. Download the requirements.txt file and the main.py
2. In the directire of the requirements.txt and main.py file open a terminal
3. You'll need pip3 '''sudo apt install python3-pip'''
4. Next run '''pip3 install requirements.txt'''
5. From there you can make the main.py executable by right clicking on it and ticking "executable"
6. Alternatively run as python file using '''python3 main.py'''

# In future I will:
1. Build a full GUI desktop application
2. Port it to android using KivyMD
3. NEVER HAVE ADS

If you'd like to follow along on my journey while I undertake this venture as a juniour-intermediate programmer feel free to do so!
